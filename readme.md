# Biospecimen Naming Convention

This repository defines a standardized naming system for biospecimens used in genomic studies, including **patient-derived xenografts (PDX)**, **cell lines**, **normal tissues**, and **primary tumors**. The naming structure encodes key metadata about each sample‚Äôs origin, type, and processing history in a compact and interpretable format.

## üîç Sample Naming Logic

The sample ID is composed of structured segments, separated by hyphens and underscores, with each part carrying specific biological or experimental meaning.


### Components:

### üìò Tissue ID Components

| Segment            | Example(s)                            | Description |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| `JH-2-00x`         | JH-2-00x                               | **Individual ID** ‚Äî unique identifier for the patient or donor |
| `a` or `0`         | `a`, `b`, `c` (tumor) or `0`, `1`, `2` (normal) | **Tumor Sequence Letter** ‚Äî for **tumors**, lowercase letters (`a`, `b`, `c`, ...) represent the order of tumor collection (chronological or collection sequence).<br>For **normal tissues**, numeric values (`0`, `1`, `2`, ...) are used to indicate collection order. |
| `PDX`              | PDX, tumor, normal,PATCL,PDXCL         | **Tissue Type** ‚Äî indicates the biological sample type, such as `PDX`, `cellline`, `tumor` (primary, recurrent, metastatic), or `normal`; PATCL: Cell line from patient Tumor; PDXCL: 
from PDX|
| `P0`               | P0, MP1, MP2                           | **Passage Number** ‚Äî specifies the generation of the PDX or cell line (`P0`, `MP1`, `MP2`, etc.).<br>This segment is **omitted for primary tumors and normal tissue samples**. |

## üß¨ Naming Principles


- **Tumor samples** are labeled using a **lowercase letter** (`a`, `b`, `c`, etc.) that reflects their **collection order**.
  - If multiple tumors are collected on the same day, the sequence is determined by the **order of collection**.
- **Normal tissue samples** are labeled using a **number** (`0`, `1`, `2`, etc.) that reflects the **order of normal sample collection**.
- **PDX and cell line samples** are labeled using their respective identifiers and include the **tumor sequence letter** (e.g., `a`, `b`) of their source tumor, allowing clear lineage tracking.
- This system ensures that **all biospecimens ‚Äî tumors, normals, and derivatives ‚Äî are traceable back to their primary source**, maintaining data integrity across studies and timepoints.

## üßæ Sample Barcodes

Each sample is also assigned a unique `parentBiospecimenID` to support tissue-specific tracking and anonymization. The `parentBiospecimenID` is constructed by combining:

- The `individualID` (e.g., `JH-2-002`)
- A **random alphanumeric suffix**, with length depending on the **sample type or batch**
- 'Aliquot_ID' is the vial information for the piece of sample that is sent for sequencing or other assay
